```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
## here is our code
library(psych)
library(dplyr)

# load data
df = msq

#select for the featues
features = select(df,active:scornful)

#only keep columns with relatively low numbers of NAs
todelete = colSums(is.na(features)) > 1500
features = features[!todelete]

# remove all rows with any NA values

todelete = is.na(rowSums(features))
features = features[!todelete,]

pcapsych = prcomp(features, scale. =  TRUE)

pcaloadings = pcapsych$rotation
l

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
